		<h2>Hi There</h2>
		<p>As you may have guessed from the URL, my name is Mike Jandreau. I'm a front-end web developer, graphic designer, and musician from Maine. There is another Mike Jandreau based in Massachussetts (he's .com, I'm .net) who does pretty much all the same stuff.</p>

		<p>We've exchanged some emails, and have concluded the universe is an odd place.</p>

		<h3>In Other News</h3>
		<p>I recently became a dad, bought a house, and started a new job. I'm not a fan of the traditional nine-to-five, but with a little one and a mortgage the stability is kind of nice.</p>

		<h4>Fun Stuff in the Works</h4>
		<p>Over the past few months I've been putting together an updated portfolio, as well as tutorials for web development, drawing, Photoshop, and animation.</p>
		<p>When I get around to it is still TBD.</p>
